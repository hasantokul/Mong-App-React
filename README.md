In this frontend React project users can add their favorite movies, songs and favorite artists. In React part I tried to use Redux with
class components and either with Hooks for adding more examples of the ways of coding with React.In styling I mostly used Reactstrap and Bootstrap
classes and components together and added css styling either by myself.
